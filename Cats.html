<h1>Rajani</h1>
<p>I have two tortoiseshell cats. My oldest cat, a short hair, is named Rajani.
    She enjoys treats and snuggling on my lap as I do my homework.
She has an unusual name by pure chance, I was trying to name her and reading a list of names
suggested for dark cats. Her head perked up when I read "Rajani" and she's responded ever since.</p>

<h1>Reese</h1>
<p>My youngest cat is named Reese, she is a medium hair part Maine Coon mix who loves playing
    with her toy mice and keeping me awake at night by meowing.
Reese hates being brushed but loves the treats she gets afterwards.</p>
