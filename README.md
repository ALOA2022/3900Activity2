# 3900Activity2
This is my web project for Activity 2. 
There is an introduction page which allows the user to select if they'd like to read about me or my cats. 
If the user selects my cats, a page pops up with two images and descriptions of my cats Rajani and Reese. 
If the user selects the page about me there is an introduction to me and two images. One of my wedding to my husband and one of my sister and me.
